# haveibeenpwned_wintask
 - A command line program that checks a list of email addresses against the database at haveibeenpwned.com to discover if those email addresses have been pwned
 - Was run daily via Windows Task

# Deprecated
- app was deprecated because the consumed API was moved behind a paywall

To resurrect
1. download the latest browser webdrivers for the browser of your choice - selenium uses these

   (app used Firefox or Chromium webdrivers)
2. locate the webdrivers in a folder called 'webdrivers' alongside the app
3. update the references in the code to the webdriver files
4. pay for API access
5. update the references in the code to the API endpoint
